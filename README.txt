-----------------------------------------------------

Files included:
 - index.html  --> Main landing page (references external images and favicon)
 - style.css   --> Styling for the page
 - README.txt  --> This file

Notes & Instructions:
1. The site uses the Ekya Schools logo hosted on Wikimedia Commons:
   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ekya-Schools-Bangalore.png
   This file is licensed CC BY-SA — attribution is required if you reuse/modify it.
If you'd prefer to host the logo locally, download the image and replace the <img> src
   in index.html with 'images/ekya-logo.png' and update the favicon link similarly.
2. Hero & section images use Unsplash-hosted images via URL.
These will load when the site
   is hosted on the web.
If you want all images offline, download and place them into an
   images/ folder and update the src/background-image urls in index.html/style.css.
3. To host on GitHub Pages:
   - Create a new repository (e.g., ekya-landing).
- Upload the files in this ZIP to the repository root.
- Go to Settings -> Pages -> Source -> Select 'main' branch and root (/) -> Save.
- Visit https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/ after a minute to view.
